# Descriptive Analytics of Wine Quality Dataset

This Jupyter Notebook contains exploratory data analysis and visualizations of the winequality dataset. The dataset contains information on various attributes of wine samples, such as pH, alcohol content, and quality rating. <br/>

## Dataset

In the analysis two dataset were used. One for the white wine and the other for the red one. Both can be found in repository. Each of datasets contains 13 input variables and one output variable (quality rating) for a total of 1598 and 4898 samples.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this notebook, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on both white and red wine dataset seperatly. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted.
We created several types of visualizations to explore the relationships between input variables and the quality rating. These included scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, and heat maps.
## Results

Our exploratory data analysis revealed several interesting insights about the winequality dataset:

The distribution of input variables is generally skewed, with some variables having a wider range of values than others.
The quality rating is positively correlated with alcohol content, but negatively correlated with volatile acidity and citric acid.
Box plots and violin plots showed that certain input variables had significantly different distributions for wines with low, medium, and high quality ratings.
Heat maps showed that certain input variables were highly correlated with each other, which could have implications for building predictive models.
## Conclusion

Overall, our exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the winequality dataset. These insights could be used to guide further analysis or to inform decisions about wine production and quality control.
